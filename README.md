# [STATISTICS 479 at UW-Madison: Deep Learning (Spring 2019)](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~sraschka/teaching/stat479-ss2019/)

## DEEPak Chopra Project

For our final project in Deep Learning, our team created a mimic [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DEEPestChopra) of Deepak Chopra that tweeted unique tweets that sounded similar to what the real Deepak Chopra would tweet. We chose [Deepak Chopra](https://twitter.com/DeepakChopra?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), because his tweets were extremely sporadic and unpredictable. By using a Char-RNN and a Word-RNN algorithms, we had some great results and won *Best Oral Presentation* and *Most Creative Project* while placing third in *Best Visualizations* out of fifteen teams.
